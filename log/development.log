There’s sure to be a lot of red meat for Republicans and eye rolling from Democrats, but there’s also a wildcard in this year’s debate: Donald Trump.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESince Trump announced his candidacy in June, his poll numbers have done nothing but increase. What’s Trump done?  Call Mexican illegal immigrants criminals. Polls go up. Give out Sen. Lindsay Graham’s cell phone. Polls go up. Suggest John McCain isn’t a war hero because he was a POW. Still leads the polls. So just how does one debate Donald Trump and win?\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe first thing we must understand is that a presidential debate is not like an academic debate. In an academic debate or in a courtroom, people who are trained to evaluate evidence and arguments get to make the decisions on who wins/loses. In a presidential debate, the American people get to evaluate the arguments. \\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EDonald Trump brings an elitist bravado back to the Republican Party. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EThe American electorate is not trained to assess the arguments and they may not be informed enough on specific issues to follow those arguments based on the relatively short answer time allowed by the formats.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAt the end of the debate, the news media will report clips that grab the headlines. What will likely make the news is a smart or a sassy one-liner, like when Ronald Reagan put to rest concerns about his mental capacity in his second debate with Walter Mondale, by answering the question about whether a candidate\\u0026#8217;s age should matter by saying, \\u0026#8220;I will not, for political purposes, exploit my opponent\\u0026#8217;s youth and inexperience.\\u0026#8221; Everyone laughed, and suddenly Reagan\\u0026#8217;s incompetence in the first debate no longer mattered.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe second factor that matter is the fact that people tend to vote for the candidates they like the most. This has come to be called the “beer test.” And for some Republicans, Donald Trump brings an elitist bravado back to the Republican Party. Do most people think they’d like to have a beer with Donald Trump? Honestly, probably not. But in a race with 15 other candidates, Donald Trump is a well-known personality—a celebrity—that has defined, an refined his career by delivering one-liners.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"pull-quote\\\"\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003E Trump’s rhetoric will beg for a gut reaction that only serves to help seal a candidate’s fate. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\\"quote-line\\\"\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003EDebating Donald has both pros and cons. Being on stage means getting more press. Fox News has put Donald Trump front and center on the stage flanked by Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, the two other candidates with double-digit approval ratings. Debates offer candidates the opportunity to gain free publicity for their ideas and intellect.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe negative of appearing with Trump, however, is that one has no idea what he might say or do. It is imperative that candidates not respond to him in a way that makes them look unlikable or incompetent. Trump’s rhetoric will beg for a gut reaction that only serves to help seal a candidate’s fate.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf any one of the candidates were my clients, I would tell them to be more concerned with his own image. It is important to come across well informed and likable. The danger for Trump is that someone could easily get him to lose his cool and do something else that voters might perceive as un-presidential.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThe take home that many candidates must remember is that Trump, even though he is leading in the polls, is not seen by virtually any political experts as being a viable candidate. Trump, however, can do significant damage to candidate’s outlook. While it’s highly unlikely he will be the candidate, he will ultimately help Republicans select one.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003EWe welcome your comments at\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://ideas@qz.com\\\"\\u003E ideas@qz.com\\u003C/a\\u003E.\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=474040\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/474040/a-gop-candidates-guide-to-debating-donald-trump-dont-debate-him/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-08-06T11:05:01-07:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/474040\",\"dc_creator\":\"Nichelle McNabb\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rtx1mk3v.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#38;strip=all\\u0026#38;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"RICOH Women\\u0026#039;s British Open 2015\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/rtx1mk3v.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#38;strip=all\\u0026#38;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/474040/a-gop-candidates-guide-to-debating-donald-trump-dont-debate-him/"], ["published_at", Thu, 06 Aug 2015 18:05:01 UTC +00:00], ["title", "A GOP candidate&#8217;s guide to debating Donald Trump: don&#8217;t debate him"], ["updated_at", Thu, 06 Aug 2015 20:36:16 UTC +00:00]]

But these arguments are short-sighted; the value of the tax deferral is not just getting people to save more.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EFirst of all, most estimates overstate the cost to tax-payers. 401(k)s are tax \\u003Cem\\u003Edeferred\\u003C/em\\u003E not tax free. The $399 billion dollar amount is an estimate of how much taxes working people avoid by contributing minus how much retirees pay when they withdraw each year. The government is losing so much money because 401(k)s are still relatively new and people are only now starting to retire and withdraw from them.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s also worth noting that the tax deferred status of these retirement accounts come with risks for savers. In particular, savers are making a bet on what future tax rates will be when they make withdrawals.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESecond, the taxes retirees pay on withdrawals are a powerful tool for policy makers to alter spending in retirement. Without facing a tax on withdrawals, someone might spend everything quickly and rely on government benefits. Others will spend too little and face a needlessly spare retirement\\u003Cstrong\\u003E.\\u003C/strong\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETax incentives can get people to behave better. Currently, Americans pay a tax penalty if they don\\u0026#8217;t take out a \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.schwab.com/public/file/P-1624444/Final_RMD_Guide.pdf\\\"\\u003Ecertain amount\\u003C/a\\u003E from their retirement accounts each year after turning 70.5.

And that\\u0026#8217;s where Li\\u0026#8217;s services get a lot darker. For a certain price, he explained, there are ways to “disrupt” the illegitimate relationship, without confronting the cheating husband.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003EFirst, Li will see if the mistress has a boyfriend—i.e. a man for whom she actually has feelings—and will bring evidence of her affair to him, in the hope that her boyfriend will persuade her to end her relationship with the married man.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003EIf this doesn’t work, or if there is no boyfriend, then Li will chat to the mistress’s family in the hope that they will instead do the serious talking. “Sometimes, though, the girl is from a really poor family,” he said. “These are the most likely to want to stay with their married man, because they really have no other way to make money.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003EIn cases like this, he said, he will have to visit the mistress directly. “I can scare her, threaten her with violence, and tell her that there will be trouble if she doesn’t stop seeing her married man,” he said. Ultimately though, some girls do not heed his warning, and it is in these cases that extreme measures are required. “If it comes to it—if the girl will absolutely not give up the man—then we must take a different approach,” he explained. “We must make it so that the man finds her less attractive.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003EHis most extreme service costs the client 100,000 yuan ($16,100). Li said he will enlist thugs armed with a bottle of acid and a knife.

It is so important, in fact, that an eligible bachelor can be said to be judged by the size of his mortgage. Young men typically \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20130123000093\\u0026amp;cid=1103\\\"\\u003Euse their parents’ money\\u003C/a\\u003E to pay the down payment on a house, often before finding a partner. The problem with this is that because he bought his house before marriage, unless he adds his wife\\u0026#8217;s name to the deed it will remain his if the couple divorces.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003EThis leaves women in a predicament. Staying in a bad marriage, of course, means continuing unhappiness—but leaving could mean homelessness.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003EThere also remains some social stigma to being a female divorcee in China, which can add to the difficulty of finding a new partner. “Traditional attitudes among men looking for a partner emphasize the woman’s purity, or chastity,” said Sandy To, a lecturer at the Department of Sociology of the University of Hong Kong. Being a divorcee lowers these values in a woman; it is no longer true to say that society itself frowns upon divorce but, To added, “although society won’t judge you, new partners will.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003EUltimately, the choice between divorce and staying married is an intensely private one, and while social stigmas are fading (\\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/11654006/Social-networks-blamed-for-Chinas-rising-divorce-rate.html\\\"\\u003Edivorce rates are rising rapidly\\u003C/a\\u003E), one would hope the law catches up with the times. Meanwhile, To added, there remains another powerful reason why some married women choose to spend so much money on a dangerous and possibly brutal means of ousting a mistress: “Maybe they just still love their husbands; maybe they believe things can still work out.”\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=468767\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/468767/chinese-women-pay-thugs-thousands-of-dollars-to-win-back-their-cheating-husbands/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2015-08-06T17:30:54-07:00\",\"category\":\"China's Transition\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/preview/468767\",\"dc_creator\":\"Richard Macauley\",\"media_content_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/rtrp3ei.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#38;strip=all\\u0026#38;w=150\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"PROSTITUTE WAITS FOR CUSTOMERS AT A BAR DISTRICT IN SHANGHAI.\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/rtrp3ei.jpg?quality=80\\u0026#38;strip=all\\u0026#38;w=150\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/468767/chinese-women-pay-thugs-thousands-of-dollars-to-win-back-their-cheating-husbands/"], ["published_at", Fri, 07 Aug 2015 00:30:54 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Chinese women pay thugs thousands of dollars to win back their cheating husbands"], ["updated_at", Fri, 07 Aug 2015 00:32:22 UTC +00:00]]
